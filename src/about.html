        I'm a Portland-based Visual Designer specializing in the
        intersection of brand identity and digital product experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        Right now, I'm designing for Rejuvenation, a Williams-Sonoma brand,
        where I work across site UI/UX, marketing campaigns, and digital
        storytelling. Recent projects include refreshing the visual identity
        of our influencer program and prototyping new shopping tools that
        make complex configurations feel intuitive.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before Rejuvenation, I spent nearly six years at a fair trade B2B
        company where I worked on everything from responsive web design to
        art direction for photoshoots in South America. I rehabilitated the
        company image starting with the print catalog, refined the email
        strategy, and leaned into motion design to help tell more compelling
        stories about artisan partnerships.
      </p>

      <p>
        I studied design at Madison Area Technical College, where I learned
        from working professionals with decades of experience. Today, that
        foundation helps me collaborate closely with developers and lead
        design on complex builds—because I know what's possible, and how to
        ask for it.
